This assignment involves learning the debug tool and 

proess.

I chose the Keil uvision debug tool.  To debug thru the 

CMSIS DAP, the mbed board's firmware was upgraded 

first, follow by installation of Keil uVision 5.

The source code was exported and for Keil tool chain, 

where it was rebuilt, and downloaded to the target.  

From here, breakpoints were inserted, debug session is 

started.  I was able to step thru different parts of 

the code and watch values of variables change.

Hours spent on this assignment:  4 hours

Hours spend on reading Embedded Systems (Wiki):  3 hours

I do not have the Embedded Software Primer book.
